<<<<<<< HEAD
Every team members have the admin access for this repo. Also, I have created 2 branches: *master*(for offical using) and *dev* (for developement). 

The basic rule is that: *team members should always commit their changes on dev branch, and master branch should only be changed when everyone coem togather and make sure that the commit version is reliable*

PS: you can change your working branch on the top left coner on project page or using 

`$ git checkout dev` 

if you are using command line tools on your own computer.
